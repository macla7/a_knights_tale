Spent HOURS trying to slog through a very un-organised attempt. You'd think hopefully I've learnt my lesson on planning. Anyway. Had to abandon ship and seek out a good structure to base it off. I looked at other students soloutions, and that DorskFR guy's solotuion was soooo good. Beautiful to behold!

SO I based my program essentially off of their structure/classes, to try and guide me into the right direction. Although I think I'm going to try and come back and attempt this completely afresh sometime in the future, as the struggle is what helps you learn..!
